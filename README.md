# Evaluation of Womenâ€™s Wealth Effect on Health (Pakistan)
Abstract: The world is progressing in terms of innovation and research in all areas, including health, education, and a more modern approach to reducing gender and social inequality.
However, many nations are still on the verge of providing adequate healthcare facilities, quality education, and assistance during difficult times (Akin, J.S., Birdsall, Ferranti, D.M. 1987). In
Pakistan, where the socioeconomic gradient of health appears to be dependent on multiple factors, recent surveys by demographic and health surveys reveal a decline in women's access
to basic needs compared to men at home or in general (Mustafa et al., 2015). This factor worsens further when demographic and wealth indexes are considered. This paper attempts to
determine the causal inference of women based on the socioeconomic gradient by health using the Instrumental variable. Discerning regarding the effect of wealth on women's health when
based on variables such as wealth, status, educational attainment, household control, healthcare, and number of children. To evaluate the concerns of endogeneity and reverse
causality, this paper employs an Instrumental approach and 2sls robust estimation method. The paper utilises Pakistan's (2017-18) demographic and health survey data, with body mass index
serving as a health indicator and overall wealth score as an endogenous parameter. Strong evidence indicates that controlled results have a significant impact on health; however,
additional evidence is required to quantify model results by identifying the influence of precise control variables. The paper demonstrates a strong correlation between health and wealth using
an empirical approach.
